# Bundled References

In this paper we address the challenge of providing linearizablerange query operations for linked data structures by introducing a new building block; we call bundled references. Using bundled references provides range queries with a path through the data structure consistent with their linearization point. Our design guarantees that range queries only traverse nodes belonging to their snapshot and that they never block writers. With multi-version concurrencycontrol (MVCC) in mind, we implement our technique in three data structures. The experimental evaluation of our bundled linkedlist, skip list, and binary search tree, including their integration as indexes in the DBx1000 in-memory database, shows up to 20% improvement over state-of-the-art techniques to provide linearizable range queries, as well as a more consistent performance profile across a variety of workloads

# Implementation notes

This work graciously builds on a benchmark developed by Arbel-Raviv and Brown's work (https://bitbucket.org/trbot86/implementations/src/master/cpp/range_queries/) to provide linearizable range queries in linked data structures. We use their codebase as a starting point, and integrate our technique into their benchmark. The core of our bundling implementation is contained in the 'bundle' directory, which implements the global structures as well as necessary functions of bundling. The three data structures we implement are found in 'bundled_*' directories. The scripts necessary to produce the plots found in our paper are included under the 'microbench' directory.
